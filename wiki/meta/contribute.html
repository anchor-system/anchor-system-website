        I have taken lots of time to create this wiki and come up with this system. It would be incredibly helpful to me
        if you could help support the efforts, you can find links to do so on the <a href="../../index.html">main
        page</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Content</h2></div>

    <p>
        If you have new ideas, edits or additions that you believe would be beneficial to the system, then I would
        encourage you to try and get those changes in. One way you can do this is by contacting the creator of the
        system <a href="https://cuppajoeman.com">cuppajoeman</a> with your potential changes, otherwise if you're more
        computer savvy you can make edits through github and do a pull request. For larger changes I recommend you
        discuss in the discord channel first before doing modifications.

        <h2 class="line_text">Recognition</h2></div>

    <p>
        The anchor system is relatively new and so it needs all the help it can get to become more well known. If you're
        able to introduce it to other musician friends or collegues it would be helpful to get the system more well
        known.
