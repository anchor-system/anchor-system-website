        <h2 class="line_text">Overview</h2></div>

    <p>
        The Anchor System is an alternate music system which uses a different notation and way of thinking which is more
        conducive to music creation and improvisation, especially on instruments whose layouts are not directly
        understandable.
    </p>


    <p>
        The anchor system was created in 2019-2021 and has been stable since 2022, it was created when I was trying to mathematically figure out how to construct chords on guitar minimizing the amount of memorization needed to do so.

        <h2 class="line_text">Specifics</h2></div>

    <ul>
        <li>The Anchor System works well on fretted stringed instruments as well as keyboard instruments</li>
        <li>Allows you to create chords without having to memorize shapes</li>
        <li>Gets you able to play along with songs you like quickly</li>
        <li>It allows you to be aware of what you are playing and to stop noodling</li>
        <li>Minimize the amount of information you memorize and construct ideas quickly</li>
        <li>Use notation which lets you connect the music to theory as you play</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In general in music we learn tunes and chord changes in all twelve keys, reading notes and understanding them as intervals relative to some root. In this notation different chord sequences such as Dmin7 G7 Cmaj7 and Emin7 B7 Dmaj7 both are notationally different, but within their respective key centers (C major and D major) they are functionally the same, therefore the notation should reflect that they are notationally the same, the anchor system provides an alternate way to interact with music that makes these relationships more obvious by considering every note as its own "roman numeral".

        <h2 class="line_text">Interoperability</h2></div>

    <p>
        Even though you're using a non-standard system, you will still be able to read and understand sheet music as
        well as
        educational content written in the standard system and be able to express your own ideas in the standard system,
        meaning that you'll be able to interact normally with other musicians who do not use the standard system.
