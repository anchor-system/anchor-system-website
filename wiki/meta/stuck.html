    <p>
        When you're learning this system, I'm sure at some point you will come across something which doesn't click
        straight away or that will be difficult for you to learn.
    </p>


    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Self</h2></div>

    <p>
        When you encounter this type of situation I recommend you go back to the basics, and try to rebuild your
        understanding from there until you get back to where you were. This will work most of the time because this
        system has been built in this way so that you can synthesize most of the information you need from a small
        collection of memorized information.

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Others</h2></div>

    <p>
        If you're still stuck, then I would recommend falling back on other people who have already taken the time to
        understand the system, who can give you new perspectives on the concept to help you understand. I recommend
        connecting on discord and asking your questions there.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">One on one</h2></div>

    <p>
        The fastest way to learn this system is to have one on one help you learn the concepts, the following people are
        available to teach one on one:
