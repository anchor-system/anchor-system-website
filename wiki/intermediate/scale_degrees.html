    <p>
        Scale degrees are a method of indexing a scale. Normally the scale we index is the major scale.
    </p>


    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Enumerating the Major Scale</h2></div>

    <p>
        Let's say we wanted to enumerate the C major scale, then what we would do is this
    </p>

    <table class="center">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Scale<br></th>
            <th>C</th>
            <th>D</th>
            <th>E</th>
            <th>F</th>
            <th>G</th>
            <th>A</th>
            <th>B</th>
            <th>C</th>
            <th>D</th>
            <th>E</th>
            <th>F</th>
            <th>G</th>
            <th>A</th>
            <th>B</th>
            <th>C</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Index<br></td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>6<br></td>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>10<br></td>
            <td>11</td>
            <td>12<br></td>
            <td>13</td>
            <td>14</td>
            <td>15</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        The convention is normally that we are referencing a major scale unless specified otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
        This process also works just fine on any other major scale, so we could take the F# major scale like this
    </p>

    <table class="center">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Scale<br></th>
            <th>F#<br></th>
            <th>G#<br></th>
            <th>A#<br></th>
            <th>B<br></th>
            <th>C#<br></th>
            <th>D#<br></th>
            <th>F</th>
            <th>F#</th>
            <th>G#<br></th>
            <th>A#<br></th>
            <th>B<br></th>
            <th>C#<br></th>
            <th>D#<br></th>
            <th>F<br></th>
            <th>F#<br></th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Index<br></td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>6<br></td>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>10<br></td>
            <td>11</td>
            <td>12<br></td>
            <td>13</td>
            <td>14</td>
            <td>15</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Combining with the Anchor System</h2></div>

    <p>
        If you recall, in the anchor system, the way we think about scales is a little differently, we're able to think
        about any major scale by simply remembering the pattern 0 2 4 5 7 9 11, and starting on different positions on
        the neck.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now if we were to do the same thing as we've done above but for our notation we would get something like this
    </p>

    <table class="center">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Scale<br></th>
            <th>0<br></th>
            <th>2</th>
            <th>4<br></th>
            <th>5<br></th>
            <th>7<br></th>
            <th>9<br></th>
            <th>11<br></th>
            <th>0<br></th>
            <th>2<br></th>
            <th>4</th>
            <th>5<br></th>
            <th>7<br></th>
            <th>9<br></th>
            <th>11<br></th>
            <th>0<br></th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Index<br></td>
            <td><i>1</i></td>
            <td><i>2</i></td>
            <td><i>3</i></td>
            <td><i>4</i></td>
            <td><i>5</i></td>
            <td><i>6</i><br></td>
            <td><i>7</i></td>
            <td><i>8</i></td>
            <td><i>9</i></td>
            <td><i>10</i><br></td>
            <td><i>11</i></td>
            <td><i>12</i><br></td>
            <td><i>13</i></td>
            <td><i>14</i></td>
            <td><i>15</i></td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        You can see that this starts to get a little confusing, as the index is a number and the way we reference our
        note is a number (anchor interval).
    </p>

    <p>
        Over time you will be able to make this distinction yourself, for now we will italicize the
        index numbers so that we can differentiate. So we know that 5 is an anchor interval and <i>5</i> is an index
        which references the anchor interval 7.
    </p>

    <div class="line_behind"><span class="line"></span>
        <h2 class="line_text">Use in Chords</h2></div>

    <p>
        Let's say we saw a chord which was a G7 add 9 while our anchor note is C, the way we could make sense of this is
        first by inspecting the quality which is dom7, defining the distances of 0 4 7 10. In a chord when we see a
        number after the quality it is referencing the enumeration system we've come up with in the previous section. So
        the chord would really look like G7 add <i>9</i> (with the italic) if we didn't want it to be confusing at all.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now if we reference our table we can see that <i>9</i> references the anchor interval 2, and so we just add
        (hence the naming 'add 9') this to the distances defined by our quality, so dom7 <i>9</i> defines the quality 0
        4 7 10 2, then we can stack that onto 7 (the anchor interval of G) and get 7 11 2 5 9, then construct it on the
        guitar.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally we can flatten or sharpen these numbers so that the represent something else, so for example if we
        saw the chord G7 b<i>9</i> (it could be written as G7 add b<i>9</i>, but the 'add' is optional), then of course
        we get the 0 4 7 10 from the dom7 quality, then we would take the <i>9</i> which represent 2 (from the original
        enumeration table) and then flatten it to become a 1.
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore when we see a G7 b9 the distances defined by the quality would be 0 4 7 10 1, and stacking that on
        7 (Gs anchor interval) we get 7 11 2 5 8.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the examples we've seen the extra numbers at the end of a quality have added to a chord. But sometimes their
        purpose is to actually modify the chord itself, we can see an example of this in an actual song:
    </p>


    <img class="inverted_image" src="../assets/scale_degrees/take_the_a_train.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;">

    <p>
        We can see that the second chord is D7b<i>5</i>, breaking this apart we can see that we first have a D7 chord,
        if we inspect the quality we know that it is a dominant 7th chord, and therefore is defined by the distances 0 4
        7 10.
    </p>

    <p>
        Taking a look at the b <i>5</i>, we will go to our enumeration system and see that <i>5</i> references 7 and so
        b<i>5</i> references 6 combining that with the dom7 quality we get 0 4 7 10 6. We can see that we have a 7 and 6
        in the chord at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we played the 6 and 7 we would get more dissonance that might be expected, so in this case we let the 6
        'override' the 7, and instead consider the whole quality as 0 4 6 10.
    </p>

    <p>
        Stacking this on 2 (Ds anchor interval), we get 2 6 8 0 which would be the anchor intervals we use in the bar
        for D7b<i>5</i>.
