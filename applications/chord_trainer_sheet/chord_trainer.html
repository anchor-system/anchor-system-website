<h1>Anchor System Work Sheet</h1>
<p>
    At the end of the day, in order to build stuff on the guitar, we are going to need anchor intervals, a common
    structure in music are chords, so we'll come up with a method on how to convert a chord into a collection of ai's.
</p>

<h2>Quality Structures</h2>
<p>
    A quality is what you see after a note in a chord, so for example if we take the chord F maj7, then the quality is
    maj7. The quality defines a collection of distances relative to the root (F) of the chord. Here are some of the main
    chords:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        maj7: 0 4 7 11
    </li>
    <li>
        min7: 0 3 7 10
    </li>
    <li>
        dom7: 0 4 7 10
    </li>
    <li>
        half-dim7: 0 3 6 10
    </li>
    <li>
        dim7: 0 3 6 9
    </li>
    <li>
        min-maj7: 0 3 7 11
    </li>
    <li>
        maj6: 0 4 7 9
    </li>
    <li>
        min6: 0 3 7 9
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Format</h2>

<p>
    The left note is the anchor note. The first step is to figure out what it is as it's number representation, so for
    example if that note was B, then we'd think of the representation 11*.
</p>

<p>
    The next step is to look at the root of the chord, so for example if the chord we're interested in was Eb dim7, then
    we'd look at Eb and convert that to it's number representation which would be 3*.
</p>

<p>
    With the anchor note and the root of the chord written as numbers we can easily compute the anchor interval of the
    root of the chord by asking ourselves what we need to add to 11* to get to 3*, which would be 4.
</p>

<p>
    Once we have the anchor interval of the root of the chord, we use the quality structure to stack on top of that
    anchor interval. So in our example we have dim7 which defines the distances 0 3 6 9, and then stacking that onto 4
    we would obtain 4 7 10 1, which is what we would write in the blank.
</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>
<p>
    You'll find that once you have the quality structures under your control the longest part of the process is finding
    the anchor interval and also stacking the distances onto the anchor interval.
</p>

<p>
    The key to getting faster at this is to use the small representation to reduce the complexity of a computation, for
    example a beginner might solve a question like 10 + 6, by getting to 16, then seeing that 16 is 4 more than 12 so
    their answer would be 4, due to that reasoning.
</p>

<p>
    A more experienced player would see 10 as the same thing as -2, since moving ten steps one direction leaves you at
    the same note as moving the opposite direction twice. Therefore we can reduce 10 + 6 to -2 + 6 = 4, which is much
    simpler to solve. Here are the following "small representations" of numbers:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>0, -0</li>
    <li>1, -11</li>
    <li>2, -10</li>
    <li>3, -9</li>
    <li>4, -8</li>
    <li>5, -7</li>
    <li>6, -6</li>
    <li>7, -5</li>
    <li>8, -4</li>
    <li>9, -3</li>
    <li>10, -2</li>
    <li>11, -1</li>
    <li>0, -0</li>
</ul>
